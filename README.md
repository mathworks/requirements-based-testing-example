# Requirements-Based Testing Workflow Example

## Overview
This example workflow shows users how to get started with systematic, requirements-based testing using Simulink Verification and Validation products.

## Agenda

In Part 1, users will learn how to:

- create a test harness
- create a temporal assessment to define pass/fail criteria
- create a test case using the harness and the assessment
- link the test case to the requirement
execute the created test case to determine whether the test passed

In Part 2, users will learn how to:

- execute a test suite using Simulink® Test™
- measure model test coverage
- generate tests to analyze missing test coverage
- resolve missing test coverage
- ensure test coverage is based on the requirements
